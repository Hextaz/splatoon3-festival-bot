# Test Plan for Interaction Timeout Fix

## Changes Made:
1. Moved `safeDefer(interaction, true)` to the very beginning of `/start-festival` command execution
2. This should prevent the 3-second Discord interaction timeout

## Test Steps:
1. Run `/start-festival` command in Discord
2. Verify that the command responds immediately with the team size selection
3. Click on a team size button (2v2, 3v3, 4v4)
4. Verify that it proceeds to game mode selection without timeout errors
5. Continue through the entire festival setup flow

## Expected Results:
- No "Unknown interaction" errors
- No "Interaction has already been acknowledged" errors  
- Smooth progression through all setup steps
- Festival creation completes successfully

## If Issues Persist:
- Check that all button handlers in `handleFestivalSetup` are properly deferring
- Consider adding defer calls to other critical commands that might be taking too long
- Monitor Render logs for specific error patterns
